**********
Alt-H5 What is a browser? 
it is a software application for retrieving, presenting, and traversing information resources on the *World Wide Web*. 
 An information resource is identified by a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI/URL) and may be a web page, image, video or other piece of content.
 The browser main functionality is to present the web resource you choose, by requesting it from the server and displaying it on the browser window. The resource format is usually HTML but also PDF, image and more. The location of the resource is specified by the user using a URI (Uniform resource Identifier)
