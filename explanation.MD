#H1 How browsers work
**********
Alt-H5 What is a browser? 
it is a software application for retrieving, presenting, and traversing information resources on the *World Wide Web*. 
 An information resource is identified by a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI/URL) and may be a web page, image, video or other piece of content.
 The browser main functionality is to present the web resource you choose, by requesting it from the server and displaying it on the browser window. The resource format is usually HTML but also PDF, image and more. The location of the resource is specified by the user using a URI (Uniform resource Identifier)
 The way the browser interprets and displays HTML files is specified in the HTML and CSS specifications. These specifications are maintained by the **World Wide Web Consortium** organization, which is the standards organization for the web.
A browser has a user interface that most commonly includes an address bar, back/forward button, and reload button, sometimes refered to this as the “chrome”  of a browser (little “c”, not Chrome by Google). When you navigate to a URL in the address bar you are making a “request” for the content at that URL.
